# Graduation-Project
In this repository, I published my graduation project, which is a website that helps people with special needs by providing some material assistance, educational courses, and advice posts to improve their lives and make them look more comfortable. This website was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Ajax, NodeJS, MongoDB and so on
